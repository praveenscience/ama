### Quick Intro

I am [Praveen Kumar](https://praveen.science/), a Cook, Cat Lover, Front End Architect, a Full Stack Web Developer Evangelist & Cloud Computing Consultant. I write about [My Adventures](https://blog.praveen.science/) and tweet at [@praveenscience](https://twitter.com/praveenscience).

This is a quick little ask-me-anything type of repository. This seems like a pretty fantastic idea in lieu of traditional blog comments, email, and the like.

If you have any technical problems with Git or GitHub, you're better off [asking GitHub Support directly](https://github.com/contact), since you'll end up getting a much faster response back that way.

### Ask a question

Asking a question is as easy as [creating a new issue](https://github.com/praveenscience/ama/issues/new) on this project.

I'll try to answer it as soon as I can get to it. Once I answer I'll close the issue just so I know what I've covered, but don't worry if you have any further questions, just respond in the thread and I'll get back to you soon. Feel free to ask a question on any old issue too, even if you didn't create it.

---

### Read some questions

Check out the [Closed Issues](https://github.com/praveenscience/ama/issues?sort=created&direction=desc&state=closed&page=1) filter on this repository to browse questions I've answered in the past. I try to use this as an email replacement that everyone can see, so feel free to dig into some of the older threads.

### Guidelines

- Ensure your question hasn't already been answered.
- Use a succinct title and description.
- Bugs & feature requests should be opened on the relevant issue tracker.
- Support questions are better asked on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/462627/praveen-kumar).
- Be civil and polite.

### Twitter

If you have something quick and easy, just ping me on Twitter. 280 characters makes everyone more efficient. I'm [@praveenscience](https://twitter.com/praveenscience) on Twitter.
